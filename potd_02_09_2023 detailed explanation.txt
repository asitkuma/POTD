So today in this given question it was little bit confusing.So honestly speaking question is very simple.It just said that first thing u have to visit the leaf node only and then u need to check the price of that leaf node.And the price of that node will be equals to the level of that leav node.So how many maximum leaf nodes you can visit at this budget....so approach is very simple just visit all nodes and check it is leaf node then in a temproray array  u need to insert the level of that node...and at last just iterate through an array and check the maximum leaf nodes u can check....simple right cool now go to my code section i have written two codes one is impleted with recursion and another one is by using list....
